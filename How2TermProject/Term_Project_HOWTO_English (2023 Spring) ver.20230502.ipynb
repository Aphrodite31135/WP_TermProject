    "4. Result of the analysis: Describes what results you found using the mathematical or logical method (at least one data visualizatoin is required for hypothesis).\n",
    "5. Conclusion: Describes your hypothesis or proposition in detail.\n",
    "6. References: Lists the data, internet information, papers, books, etc. acquired for your work.\n",
